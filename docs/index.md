**conTAct is a desktop application for managing contact details, specially designed for Tutor Assistants.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using conTAct, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing conTAct, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
